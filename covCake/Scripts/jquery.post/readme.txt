This plugin allows you to submit any form including file upload with out leaving the page. Just tell which form you would like to submit and it will create a invisible iframe which will clone all input, textarea and select elements and submit it to a given url.This was created to make a very simple way, to upload multiple files with one request, with out leaving the page.Usage://$(selector).post_form(action_url, on_complete_function)$("#form_id").post_form("/edit/", function(data){alert('result='+data);});Note: This is only a 0.1 version of the plugin and it's not fully tested.
