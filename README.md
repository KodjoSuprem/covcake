[ARCHIVE] Pet project from 2009, since discontinued.

Find a travel companion with covoyage.net, share your experiences, photos, and plan your next travel :)

I enjoyed using brand new technologies at the time : C# 3.5, ASP.NET MVC, LINQ to SQL, Razor templates, etc...

This project have been forked as a corporate car pooling application.
